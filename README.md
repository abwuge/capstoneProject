# Research on Nonlinear Reconstruction Method of Particle Velocity in AMS Time-of-Flight Detector

## Project Introduction

This project aims to study the nonlinear reconstruction method of particle velocity in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector. AMS is a particle physics experiment operating on the International Space Station, and the TOF detector is used to measure the flight direction and velocity of charged particles. However, due to the ionization energy loss of charged particles in the TOF material, the particles decelerate. If a linear function is used to fit the time-space relationship of the particles, it will lead to a certain bias in the particle velocity reconstruction, which is more pronounced at low energies.

This study introduces the particle energy loss term in the particle velocity fitting process for nonlinear fitting to reduce the bias in velocity reconstruction and improve accuracy. This will help AMS to more accurately identify nuclear isotopes.

## Abstract

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a particle physics experiment operating on the International Space Station. The Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector of AMS is used to measure the flight direction and velocity of charged particles. Due to the ionization energy loss of charged particles in the TOF material, the particles decelerate. If a linear function is used to fit the time-space relationship of the particles, it will lead to a certain bias in the particle velocity reconstruction, which is more pronounced at low energies. This study intends to introduce the particle energy loss term in the particle velocity fitting process for nonlinear fitting to reduce the bias in velocity reconstruction and improve accuracy, contributing to the identification of nuclear isotopes by AMS.
